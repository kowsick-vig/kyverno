# üõ°Ô∏è Kyverno Default-Deny NetworkPolicy Generator

This Kyverno `ClusterPolicy` automatically creates a **default deny-all `NetworkPolicy`** in any new **Namespace**.
It helps enforce a **zero-trust** model by **blocking all ingress and egress traffic** unless explicitly allowed.

---

## üìã Policy Description

* Kubernetes by default allows unrestricted communication between all Pods across Namespaces.
* This policy ensures that **each new Namespace** automatically gets a `NetworkPolicy` called `default-deny` which:

  * **Selects all Pods** (`podSelector: {}`).
  * **Denies all Ingress and Egress traffic**.
* Application teams must define additional `NetworkPolicy` resources to allow specific traffic as needed.
* This improves cluster security and aligns with **EKS Best Practices** and **multi-tenancy models**.

## üöÄ How to Apply This Policy

Follow these steps to implement the Kyverno policy:

1. **Ensure Kyverno is installed in your cluster**:

   If Kyverno is not already installed, you can install it using:

   ```bash
   kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyverno/kyverno/main/config/install.yaml
   ```

2. **Apply the ClusterPolicy**:

   Save the policy YAML to a file (e.g., `add-networkpolicy.yaml`) and apply it:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f add-networkpolicy.yaml
   ```

3. **Verify that the policy is active**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get clusterpolicy
   ```

   You should see `add-networkpolicy` listed.

4. **Test the Policy**:

   * Create a new Namespace:

     ```bash
     kubectl create namespace test-ns
     ```

   * Check if a `NetworkPolicy` named `default-deny` was automatically created inside `test-ns`:

     ```bash
     kubectl get networkpolicy -n test-ns
     ```

     Expected output:

     ```bash
     NAME           POD-SELECTOR   AGE
     default-deny   <all pods>     <seconds>
     ```

5. **(Optional) Allow Specific Traffic**:

   After applying the default deny policy, application teams must create additional `NetworkPolicy` resources to explicitly allow necessary communications.

## üì¢ Important Notes

* Your Kubernetes cluster must have a **CNI plugin** that supports **NetworkPolicy** enforcement, such as:

  * Calico
  * Cilium
  * AWS VPC CNI with Policy Enforcement
* Without a compatible CNI, the `NetworkPolicy` objects will exist but will **not be enforced**.
* The `synchronize: true` option ensures that the generated `NetworkPolicy` stays updated if the policy itself changes.
